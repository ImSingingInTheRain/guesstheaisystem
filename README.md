# 🃏 AI Guess Who

A simple Streamlit game with two modes:

* **Computer guesses (app asks):** You select a card describing a technology and answer up to five yes/no
  questions from the computer, which then tries to guess whether the system is “AI” or “Not AI”.
* **You guess (you ask):** The computer secretly chooses a card. You may ask up to five questions from the
  list before making your own guess of “AI” or “Not AI”.
